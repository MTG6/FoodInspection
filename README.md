# FoodInspection
Project Work for MSiA 423


## Project Charter
Provide a Food Inspection outcome prediction to Chicago restaurateurs, based on their restaurant characteristics. Our data is pulled from the City of Chicago Data Portal.

Vision: Assist the decision process for Chicago restaurateurs in deciding how to best prepare for their upcoming Food Inspection. Mission: Use historical outcome data to build a classification model, which uses the most important characteristics of an inspection, to predict an outcome (pass or fail) for a restaurant. Success Criteria: Whether or not the modelâ€™s results are intuitive, and whether or not it performs better than the baseline.

## Steps to deploy app

1) Clone repo
2) Create an environment to run app from:
```virtualenv -p python3 FoodApp
source FoodApp/bin/activate
```
Then install the requirements file:
```pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3) Create config file with SQL database path:
```SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI  = '<URI for the database you will be using>'
```
4) Run prepare_app.py to pull data, create database, and train model. Run this every time you want to update the data and retrain the model.
5) Run FoodApp.py
